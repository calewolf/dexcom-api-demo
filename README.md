# Dexcom Demo

The following are the steps I took to get this demo working.

First, I made sure I had python3 and pip3 set up on my machine. I confirmed this by running:
```
which python3
which pip3
```

I also made sure that I had the Python extension installed on my VSCode.

Then, I set up a directory with a virtual environment using this doc: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/
